## Data structure
Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. There are several kinds of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. The choice of data structure often depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

## Algorithms
Algorithms, are a set of instructions or rules defined to solve a particular problem. An algorithm is an efficient method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function.
